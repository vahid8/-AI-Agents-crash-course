# AI Agents Crash Course

## Day 1: Ingest and Index Your Data

Today I learned how to:
- Download repos as zip archives
- Parse frontmatter metadata
- Extract content from markdown files

### Run it

First build:
```bash
docker-compose build day1
```

Then run:
```bash
docker run --rm ai_agent_crashcoourse-day1
```

To see content of one example file:
```bash
docker run --rm ai_agent_crashcoourse-day1 python main.py --example
```
